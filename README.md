#HTC BlinkFeed Authorizer
##Xposed Module
This [Xposed Module](http://repo.xposed.info/) removes the message

!["Unauthorized device - This app is not compatible with your phone."](http://ext.woalk.de/img/github/htcblinkfeedunauth.png)

from [HTC BlinkFeed/Sense Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.htc.launcher&hl=en).

###Requirements
This app requires Android 5 or 5.1 Lollipop and the **correct** Xposed Framework
for [5.0](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3034811)
or [5.1](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3072979).

Furthermore, this requires obviously HTC BlinkFeed/Sense Home.

Also, this Xposed Module **does not** make a really incompatible device compatible.
It just circumvents an occurring problem with HTC's "copy protection" of BlinkFeed's Sense libraries,
where a usually compatible, legal HTC device gets this message without justification.

###Version
The currently supported BlinkFeed/Sense Home version is
**`7.0.518379`**,
which is **not** the most recent Play Store version.

This may be updated over time.
